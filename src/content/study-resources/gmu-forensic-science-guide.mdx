- Use AI assistants (ChatGPT, Claude) for practice problems
- Do every single homework problem—twice
- Attend office hours before you're struggling

**AI Prompts That Work**:
```
"Explain the concept of limits using a forensic science example, 
like calculating the rate of decomposition. Then give me 5 practice 
problems with step-by-step solutions."
```

**Professor Tips**:

### Study Techniques That Work

**The Feynman Technique**:
1. Choose a concept (e.g., DNA replication)
2. Explain it in simple terms (as if to a 10-year-old)
3. Identify gaps in your understanding
4. Review and simplify further

**Active Recall**:
- Close your notes and write everything you remember
- Check against notes and fill gaps
- Repeat until you can recall 90%+

**Spaced Repetition**:
- Review material 1 day after learning
- Review again 3 days later
- Review again 7 days later
- Review again 14 days later
- Review before exam

**AI-Enhanced Study Sessions**:
```
"I just finished learning about bloodstain pattern analysis. 
Quiz me with 10 increasingly difficult questions. After each 
answer, tell me if I'm right and explain why. If I'm wrong, 
explain the correct answer and give me a similar question."
```
