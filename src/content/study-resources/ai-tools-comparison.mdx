Explain the process of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) 
in toxicology testing. What are the key principles, and how does it 
identify specific substances in biological samples?
```

**Runner-up: Gemini** for finding current research papers and protocols.

### For Research and Literature Reviews

**Winner: Gemini**

Gemini's integration with Google Search makes it unbeatable for finding recent studies, court cases, and forensic science developments.

**Example Prompt**:
```
Find recent peer-reviewed studies (2023-2025) on the accuracy 
of bloodstain pattern analysis. Summarize the key findings and 
any controversies in the field.
```

**Runner-up: Claude** for synthesizing information from multiple sources you provide.

### For Ethical Discussions

**Winner: Claude**

Forensic science involves complex ethical considerations. Claude's nuanced approach to ethical reasoning makes it ideal for exploring these topics.

**Example Prompt**:
```
Discuss the ethical implications of using familial DNA searching 
in criminal investigations. What are the privacy concerns, and 
how do they balance against public safety?
```

**Runner-up: ChatGPT** for generating different perspectives quickly.

### For Exam Preparation

**Winner: ChatGPT**

ChatGPT's speed and ability to generate practice questions make it perfect for exam prep.

**Example Prompt**:
```
Create 10 multiple-choice questions about forensic entomology 
at an undergraduate level, with explanations for each answer.
```

**Runner-up: Claude** for creating more challenging, essay-style questions.
