## Quick Start Guide

### For First-Time Users

**Step 1: Understand the Framework**
1. Read [PROMPT_ENGINEERING_FRAMEWORK.md](./PROMPT_ENGINEERING_FRAMEWORK.md) to understand the core principles.
2. Review the batch template structure.

**Step 2: Choose Your Path**
- **Want to add a feature?** â†’ Go to [FEATURE_ENHANCEMENT_BATCHES.md](./FEATURE_ENHANCEMENT_BATCHES.md)
- **Want to create content?** â†’ Go to [CONTENT_EXPANSION_GUIDE.md](./CONTENT_EXPANSION_GUIDE.md)
- **Have user feedback?** â†’ Go to [USER_FEEDBACK_FRAMEWORK.md](./USER_FEEDBACK_FRAMEWORK.md)

**Step 3: Execute a Batch**
1. Copy the relevant batch prompt.
2. Customize it for your specific needs.
3. Provide it to an AI agent (or execute manually).
4. Validate the results.
5. Commit to Git.

---

## How to Execute a Batch (Detailed)

### Using an AI Agent (Recommended)

1.  **Select a Batch**: Choose a pre-defined batch from one of the framework documents.
2.  **Copy the Prompt**: Copy the entire batch prompt, including all sections (Context, Objective, Tasks, etc.).
3.  **Provide to AI**: Paste the prompt into your AI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, etc.).
4.  **Monitor Execution**: The AI will execute the tasks step-by-step. Monitor for errors.
5.  **Validate**: Once complete, verify that all validation criteria are met.
6.  **Commit**: Create a Git commit with the specified message.
7.  **Deploy**: Push to GitHub, which triggers automatic deployment on Vercel.

### Manually (For Learning or Small Changes)

1.  **Read the Batch**: Understand the objective and tasks.
2.  **Execute Tasks**: Perform each task manually (create files, write code, etc.).
3.  **Test**: Validate that everything works as expected.
4.  **Commit**: Commit your changes to Git.
5.  **Deploy**: Push to GitHub.

## Batch Execution Checklist

Use this checklist for every batch you execute:

- [ ] **Read the entire batch prompt** before starting.
- [ ] **Verify prerequisites** are met.
- [ ] **Execute tasks sequentially** (unless specified as parallel).
- [ ] **Test incrementally** (don't wait until the end to test).
- [ ] **Validate all criteria** from the validation checklist.
- [ ] **Commit with the correct message format** (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.).
- [ ] **Push to GitHub** to trigger deployment.
- [ ] **Verify deployment** on the live site.
- [ ] **Document any issues** or deviations from the plan.
- [ ] **Generate the next batch prompt** (if applicable).

---

## Customizing Batches

The provided batches are templates. You can and should customize them:

### Customization Examples

**Change the Scope**:
- Original: "Implement a tag-based recommendation system."
- Customized: "Implement a tag-based recommendation system **with user preference weighting**."

**Add Constraints**:
- Original: "Create a search feature."
- Customized: "Create a search feature **using Algolia for instant search**."

**Combine Batches**:
- Combine Batch 5 and Batch 6 if they are small and related.

**Split Batches**:
- Split a large batch into two smaller ones if it's too complex.

---

## Creating New Batches

When the existing batches don't cover your needs, create a new one using this process:

### New Batch Creation Process

1.  **Identify the Need**: What problem are you solving? What feature are you adding?
2.  **Define the Objective**: Write a single, clear statement of what the batch will accomplish.
3.  **List Prerequisites**: What must exist before this batch can be executed?
4.  **Break Down Tasks**: Divide the work into 3-10 specific, executable tasks.
5.  **Define Artifacts**: What files or outputs will be produced?
6.  **Set Validation Criteria**: How will you know the batch was successful?
7.  **Write the Commit Message**: Plan the Git commit message in advance.
8.  **Generate Next Prompt**: Think about what logically comes after this batch.

### New Batch Template

```markdown
## BATCH [N]: [Descriptive Name]

### Context
[Why is this batch needed? What is the current state?]

### Objective
[Single, clear statement of what this batch accomplishes]

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Prerequisite 1
- [ ] Prerequisite 2

### Tasks

#### Task 1: [Name]
**Action**: [Specific command or operation]
**File**: [Path to file]
**Expected Output**: [What success looks like]

#### Task 2: [Name]
[Repeat structure]

### Artifacts Produced

| Artifact | Path | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| Component | src/components/... | Description |

### Validation Checklist

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

### Git Commit

**Message**: `[type]: [description] (Batch [N])`

### Next Batch Prompt

[Auto-generated prompt for the next batch]
```

## Best Practices

### For AI-Driven Execution

1.  **Be Explicit**: The more specific your prompt, the better the output.
2.  **Provide Context**: Always include the current state of the project.
3.  **Reference Existing Code**: Point the AI to existing files for style and structure.
4.  **Validate Incrementally**: Don't wait until the end to test.
5.  **Iterate**: If the first attempt isn't perfect, refine and try again.

### For Version Control

1.  **Commit After Each Batch**: One batch = one commit (or a few related commits).
2.  **Use Descriptive Messages**: Follow the format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`.
3.  **Push Regularly**: Don't let uncommitted work pile up.
4.  **Tag Major Milestones**: Use Git tags for significant releases (e.g., `v1.0-batch-10`).

### For Quality

1.  **Test on Multiple Devices**: Always check mobile responsiveness.
2.  **Check for Errors**: No console errors, no TypeScript errors.
3.  **Proofread Content**: Use Grammarly or similar for articles.
4.  **Get Feedback**: Show new features to users before considering them "done."

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "The AI didn't follow the prompt exactly."
- **Solution**: Make the prompt more explicit. Break down complex tasks into smaller steps.

**Issue**: "I got TypeScript errors after executing a batch."
- **Solution**: Review the error messages. Often, it's a missing import or type definition. Fix and re-test.

**Issue**: "The deployment failed on Vercel."
- **Solution**: Check the Vercel build logs. Common causes: missing dependencies, TypeScript errors, incorrect file paths.

**Issue**: "The batch took too long / the AI got stuck."
- **Solution**: The batch might be too complex. Split it into two smaller batches.
