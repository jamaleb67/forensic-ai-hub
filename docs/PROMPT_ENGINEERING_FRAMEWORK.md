# Forensic AI Hub: Advanced Prompt Engineering Framework

## Document Purpose

This framework enables **AI-driven iterative development** of the Forensic AI Hub platform through self-prompting batch execution. Each batch is a complete, executable unit that produces specific artifacts and generates the prompt for the next iteration.

## Core Principles

### 1. Self-Prompting Architecture

Each batch follows this structure:

```
BATCH N: [Name]
├── Objective: What this batch accomplishes
├── Prerequisites: What must exist before starting
├── Tasks: Specific, executable actions
├── Artifacts: Files and outputs produced
├── Validation: How to verify success
└── Next Prompt: Generated prompt for Batch N+1
```

### 2. Iterative Refinement

- **No long-term planning**: Each batch informs the next
- **Single source of truth**: All changes tracked in Git
- **Progressive completion**: Build incrementally
- **Continuous validation**: Test after each batch

### 3. AI-Optimized Execution

- **Explicit instructions**: No ambiguity
- **Tool-specific commands**: Shell, file, browser operations
- **Version control**: Git commit after each batch
- **Documentation**: Markdown files for all decisions

## Batch Template Structure

### Standard Batch Format

```markdown
# BATCH [N]: [Descriptive Name]

## Context
[Brief description of current state and why this batch is needed]

## Objective
[Single, clear statement of what this batch accomplishes]

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Prerequisite 1
- [ ] Prerequisite 2
- [ ] Prerequisite N

## Tasks

### Task 1: [Name]
**Action**: [Specific command or operation]
**File**: [Path to file being created/modified]
**Expected Output**: [What success looks like]

### Task 2: [Name]
[Repeat structure]

## Artifacts Produced

| Artifact | Path | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| Component | src/components/... | Description |
| Page | src/app/... | Description |
| Documentation | docs/... | Description |

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] All files created successfully
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] Components render correctly
- [ ] Tests pass (if applicable)
- [ ] Git commit created
- [ ] Deployment successful

## Git Commit

**Message**: `[type]: [description]`
**Example**: `feat: Add article recommendation system (Batch 5)`

## Next Batch Prompt

[Auto-generated prompt for the next batch based on completion]
```

## Prompt Engineering Best Practices

### 1. Clarity and Specificity

**❌ Vague**:
```
Add some user features to the website
```

**✅ Specific**:
```
Implement article bookmarking UI with the following requirements:
1. Add bookmark button to article pages (heart icon)
2. Integrate with existing userService.ts functions
3. Update bookmarks page to display bookmarked articles
4. Add visual feedback (filled/unfilled heart)
5. Persist bookmarks in Firestore
```

### 2. Tool-Specific Instructions

**For File Operations**:
```
Create file at /home/ubuntu/forensic-ai-hub/src/components/ArticleBookmark.tsx
with the following TypeScript React component...
```

**For Shell Commands**:
```
Execute: cd /home/ubuntu/forensic-ai-hub && pnpm add [package]
```

**For Git Operations**:
```
Commit with message: "feat: Add bookmark UI component"
Push to origin master
```

### 3. Contextual Awareness

**Include Current State**:
```
Current architecture:
- Authentication: Firebase Auth with Google Sign-In
- Database: Firestore with users collection
- User service: src/lib/firebase/userService.ts
- Existing functions: addBookmark(), removeBookmark()

Task: Build UI to use these existing functions
```

### 4. Validation Criteria

**Define Success**:
```
Validation:
1. Bookmark button appears on all article pages
2. Clicking bookmark adds article to Firestore
3. Bookmarks page displays all saved articles
4. UI updates immediately (optimistic updates)
5. No console errors
6. Mobile responsive
```

## Advanced Prompt Patterns

### Pattern 1: Chain-of-Thought Execution

**Structure**:
```
Step 1: Analyze current implementation
- Review existing code at [path]
- Identify integration points
- Document dependencies

Step 2: Design solution
- Create component architecture
- Define data flow
- Plan state management

Step 3: Implement
- Create files in order: [list]
- Test each component
- Integrate with existing system

Step 4: Validate
- Run dev server
- Test functionality
- Check for errors
- Commit changes
```

### Pattern 2: Conditional Branching

**Structure**:
```
IF Firebase credentials are configured:
  - Implement full authentication flow
  - Enable real-time database features
  - Add user-specific content

ELSE:
  - Implement mock authentication
  - Use local storage for persistence
  - Add note about Firebase setup
```

### Pattern 3: Iterative Refinement

**Structure**:
```
Version 1: Basic implementation
- Core functionality only
- Minimal styling
- No edge cases

Version 2: Enhancement
- Add error handling
- Improve UX
- Handle edge cases

Version 3: Polish
- Optimize performance
- Refine styling
- Add animations
```

### Pattern 4: Parallel Execution

**Structure**:
```
Execute in parallel:
1. Create component A (independent)
2. Create component B (independent)
3. Create component C (independent)

Then sequentially:
4. Integrate A, B, C into parent component
5. Test integration
6. Deploy
```

## Self-Prompting Mechanism

### How Next Prompts Are Generated

**At End of Each Batch**:
```markdown
## Batch Completion Summary

**Completed**:
